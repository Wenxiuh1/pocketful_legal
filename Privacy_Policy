Privacy Policy for Pocketful
Last Updated: December 10, 2025

Introduction

Welcome to Pocketful!

We respect your privacy and designed this app so that your data stays on your device. We do not run our own backend for Pocketful, do not require you to create an account, and do not collect, store, or sell your personal data on any server.

This privacy policy explains what information stays on your device, which permissions the app uses, and what happens when you delete the app.

Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal data on our servers.

Pocketful does not use Firebase Analytics, Supabase, or any other analytics or tracking SDK.
We do not operate a cloud database for your content, and we do not have access to what you create inside the app.

Content Stored on Your Device

When you use Pocketful, the following content may be stored locally on your device only:

Photos and images you capture or import

Audio recordings you create (for example when using the sound capture)

Text notes and written content

Drawings and doodles

Cards and collections (tin boxes) you create

This content never leaves your device unless you share it yourself using iOS system sharing (for example sending a screenshot or image to a friend).

We do not upload your creative content to any server.

Device Permissions

Pocketful requests certain system permissions only when needed:

Camera – to take photos you want to use in your cards

Photo Library – to import existing photos

Microphone – to record audio that you choose to add

These permissions are used only to let you create content inside Pocketful.
We do not use them to collect data on our servers.
You can change these permissions at any time in your device settings, but some features may not work without them.

Data Storage and Deletion

All of your creative content is stored locally on your device.

We do not provide cloud backup or account sync for Pocketful.

If you delete the app, all data stored inside the app will be deleted and cannot be recovered by us.

If you want to keep your creations, please save or export them (for example using screenshots or iOS system sharing) before deleting the app.

Data Sharing

Because we do not collect your personal data on any server:

We do not sell your data

We do not share your content with third parties

We do not use your photos, audio, or creations for any other purpose

The only time your content leaves your device is when you choose to share it (for example sending an image/card to a friend using iOS share sheet).

Children’s Privacy

Pocketful is designed to be safe for users of all ages.
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children, because we do not collect personal data at all on our servers.

Parents or guardians can manage usage and access through the device’s system settings.

Your Rights

Because we do not collect data on our servers, you control your information directly on your device:

You can view and manage your content inside the app

You can delete individual creations at any time

You can delete all data by deleting the app from your device

If you live in a region with specific privacy laws (such as the EU or California) and have questions, you can still contact us using the email below. In most cases, the answer will be that all data is stored only on your device and is not accessible to us.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. Substantial changes may also be highlighted in the app.
