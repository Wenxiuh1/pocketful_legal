Pocketful Terms of Use

Last Updated: December 2025

Welcome to Pocketful! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Pocketful mobile application (“App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

1. Eligibility and Use

By using Pocketful, you confirm that:

You have read and understood these Terms; and

If you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction), you are using the App with the permission and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising the use of the App by minors in their care.

2. Description of the Service

Pocketful is a creative journaling app that runs entirely on your device. In this version of the App, you can:

Capture photos, audio, text, and doodles as “stickers”

Arrange these elements into visual cards and collections (“tin boxes”)

Create and organize multiple themed collections on your device

All features in the current version of Pocketful are provided free of charge.
There are no in-app purchases, no subscriptions, and no paid premium features in this version.

The App does not require you to create an account and does not connect to any backend server for your content.

We may update or change features in future versions, but any major change (such as adding paid features or accounts) would be reflected in updated Terms and Privacy Policy.

3. User Content
3.1 Ownership

You retain all rights to the content you create in Pocketful, including:

Photos and images

Audio recordings

Text notes and reflections

Drawings and doodles

Cards and collections

We do not claim ownership of your content.

3.2 Storage

Your content is stored locally on your device only.
We do not upload your creative content to our servers, because we do not operate a content backend for Pocketful.

Because we do not host your content:

We cannot access, view, or modify what you create in the App

We cannot restore your data if it is lost or deleted on your device

If you choose to share your creations (for example via screenshots or system share sheet), that sharing happens through your device and the apps you choose, not through our servers.

3.3 Responsibility for Your Content

You are solely responsible for the content you create and share. You agree not to use the App to create or share content that:

Violates any applicable laws or regulations

Infringes on the rights (including intellectual property rights) of others

Contains illegal, abusive, or harmful material

4. Fees, Purchases, and Subscriptions

In the current version of Pocketful:

All features are free to use

There are no subscriptions, no one-time purchases, and no paid upgrades

The App does not use any third-party payment or subscription SDK

If we introduce paid features in the future, we will update these Terms and clearly indicate any fees within the App and in the App Store listing.

5. Privacy and Data
5.1 No Server-Side Data Collection

Pocketful is designed to run locally on your device:

We do not require you to create an account or sign in

We do not use Firebase, Supabase, or any analytics or tracking SDK

We do not collect or store your creative content or personal data on our servers

Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more details.

5.2 Device Permissions

The App may request access to:

Camera – to allow you to capture photos

Microphone – to allow you to record audio

Photo Library – to allow you to import existing images

These permissions are used solely to enable features within the App. You can manage these permissions in your device settings. If you disable a permission, the related feature may not work.

5.3 Data Loss

Because all data is stored locally on your device:

If you delete the App, all data stored within the App will be deleted and cannot be recovered by us

If your device is lost, damaged, or reset, we cannot recover your content

If you wish to keep your creations, please consider saving them outside of the App (for example, exporting or screenshotting them using your device’s system tools) before deleting the App or resetting your device.

6.1 Our Property

The App itself, including its overall design, code, graphics, templates, logos, and other non-user content, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the App

We are not liable for any loss of data, content, or profits, or for any device damage related to the use of the App

Upon deletion or discontinuation of the App, your license to use the App ends immediately. Because we do not host your data, we do not retain copies of your content after you delete the App from your device.

11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document. For significant changes, we may also provide a notice within the App.

If you continue to use the App after the updated Terms become effective, you are deemed to have accepted the changes.

12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the developer is based, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
